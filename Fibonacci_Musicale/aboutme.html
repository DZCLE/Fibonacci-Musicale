								<h3>New Coding Career</h3>
							</header>
							<p>I love coding! My summer days at the Basic C training sessions when I was 13 and
								preparing
								for a computer skills competition remains one of my most meaningful memories. Now I am
								ready
								to explore the exciting possibility of what I can bring to the field and am thrilled to
								pick
								up the fascination with computer programming when I was a teenager.</p>

							<p>I have not only a passion for ceaseless learning but also a strong initiative to turn
								that
								knowledge into action. This combination propelled my award-winning career in music and
								continues to drive me in new directions no matter what I do.</p>

							<p>The software industry, just like the art of music, has the ability to distill the
								singular to
								broadly meaningful ways. I’m excited for the new path of possibilities in technology.
								I’m
								ready to expand my creative experience to new horizons. And I’m looking forward to
								connecting with you and hearing your story! </p>

								<h3>Passion for Classical Music</h3>
							</header>
							<p>A dynamic and versatile pianist, Dean Zhang appears internationally in critically
								acclaimed
								performances. Dr. Zhang has been praised by The Miami Herald as “a powerful keyboard
								player”
								yet with a “smooth, fluid touch at the keyboard, bringing maximum expressiveness.” A
								laureate of numerous competitions, Dr. Zhang won first prize in the Snowy Range Piano
								Competition as well as the MTNA Young Artist Piano Performance Northwest Division
								Competition. He has been featured as a soloist with the New World Symphony as a winner
								of
								its concerto competition and has also performed concertos with the Shanghai University
								Symphony Orchestra, the University of Wyoming Symphony Orchestra, the National Repertory
								Orchestra Orchestra, the New World Symphony Orchestra, the Southwest Florida Symphony
								Orchestra, and mostly recently with the Tucson Symphony Orchestra and the Canton
								Symphony
								Orchestra.</p>

							<p>Dr. Zhang currently serves as principal keyboardist with the Tucson Symphony Orchestra,
								the
								Southwest Florida Symphony Orchestra and the Canton Symphony Orchestra. An active
								chamber
								musician, he co-founded the Edgewater Clarinet and Piano Duo and have toured in China.
								Established partnership with various arts organizations since 2018, the Edgewater Duo
								launched
								annual summer tours in the New England area and keeps expanding the season to other
								regions
								of
								the country.</p>

							<p>After two years of studying management science at Shanghai University, Dr. Zhang was
								granted
								a full scholarship at the University of Wyoming where he received his Bachelor and
								Master of
								Music degrees as a student of Dr. Theresa Bogard. Under the tutelage of Paul Schenly and
								Kathryn Brown, he earned the Doctor of Musical Arts degree in piano performance from the
								Cleveland Institute of Music. Dr. Zhang also studied extensively with Joela Jones,
								principal
								keyboardist of The Cleveland Orchestra. A devoted pedagogue, Dr. Zhang joined the piano
								faculty of the New England Music Camp in 2015 and has presented master classes at
								universities throughout the United States and China.</p>
